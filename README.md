# Mini-E-commerce-Checkout-Engine---SOLID
Projeto de estudo focado na prática de Design Orientado a Objetos e aplicação dos princípios SOLID utilizando Java puro. O objetivo é explorar arquiteturas extensíveis, desacopladas e de fácil manutenção através de um sistema simulado de checkout/processamento de pedidos.

🚀 Purpose of This Project

This repository was created as a learning-focused project to practice and internalize the SOLID principles and good Object-Oriented Design practices in Java.

Rather than building a production system, the intention is to:

Experiment with design decisions

Identify common architectural mistakes

Refactor code towards cleaner structures

Improve maintainability and extensibility

🎯 Main Goal

The main objective is to understand how SOLID principles influence real-world code organization, coupling, and scalability.

This project simulates a simplified checkout / order processing engine, including:

Cart management

Pricing rules & discounts

Shipping calculations

Payment processing (simulated)

Order finalization

🧱 Design Focus

The project emphasizes:

✔ Separation of responsibilities
✔ Low coupling and high cohesion
✔ Extensible business rules
✔ Interface-driven design
✔ Refactoring-oriented development

📚 Why This Exists

This repository represents my ongoing effort to move beyond “code that works” into:

Code that is easier to change

Code that is easier to test

Code that is easier to extend

Code that better models domain behavior

🧪 Learning Strategy

The development approach intentionally includes:

Initial naïve implementations

Iterative refactoring

Progressive application of SOLID principles

Exploration of design trade-offs

🛠 Tech Stack

Java (no frameworks)

Object-Oriented Programming

SOLID Principles

Basic Design Patterns

📌 Disclaimer

This is a study-oriented project, built to explore architectural concepts and design quality rather than production-ready concerns.
